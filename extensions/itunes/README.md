# iTunes Extension for Raycast

## Description

The extension works fine with iTunes app, so it should work with Music.app with some little different "terminology". 
But I haven't done the tests. 

It will create a temporary playlist named "ExtensionAlbumPlaying" in order to play an album. 

## Usage

1. Enable ```Preferences -> Advanced -> Share iTunes Library XML with other applications``` in iTunes or Music.app. 
2. Find the XML file's path and fill that in the extension's ```Library XML Path``` field. It's in your iTunes Media Folder just shown in the previous step. 
3. In the extension's preferences, choose the music app you're using, iTunes or Music.app. 
4. You're ready to go!
